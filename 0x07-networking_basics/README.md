# 0x07. Networking basics #0

## About
In this project we will mainly focus on:
* The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP
* On the Network layer with IP and ICMP

### Tasks
0. OSI model
	* [0-OSI_model](0-OSI_model)
1. Types of network
	* [1-types_of_network](1-types_of_network)
2. MAC and IP address
	* [2-MAC_and_IP_address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)
3. UDP and TCP
	* [3-UDP_and_TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)
4. TCP and UDP ports

	Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:
	* That only shows listening sockets
	* That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
	* [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
5. Is the host on the network

	Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

	Requirements:
	* Accepts a string as an argument
	* Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
	* Ping the IP 5 times
	* [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
